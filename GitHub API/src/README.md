# GitHub API
The gitHubAPI.py program allows the user to enter the login credentials of a GitHub account, 
and then visualises on a bar chart the number of commits for each repository on their account.
To run, simply type the command
```
$ python gitHubAPI.py
```
while in the appropriate directory.
